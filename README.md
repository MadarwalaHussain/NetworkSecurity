# Phishing Website Detection - Machine Learning Problem Statement

## 🎯 **Problem Definition**

**Primary Objective**: Develop a robust machine learning classifier to automatically detect and classify websites as either **legitimate** or **phishing** based on their URL characteristics and website features, helping protect users from cyber fraud and identity theft.

## 📊 **Dataset Overview**

- **Dataset Size**: ~11,055 records
- **Features**: 30+ attributes across multiple categories
- **Target Variable**: Binary classification (Legitimate vs Phishing)
- **Source**: Krishna Naik's Phishing Classifier Dataset

## 🔍 **Feature Categories**

### 1. **Address Bar Features**
- URL Length (suspicious if >54 characters)
- Presence of IP Address instead of domain name
- Use of URL shortening services (bit.ly, tinyurl)
- Presence of '@' symbol in URL
- Redirection patterns
- Prefix/Suffix separated by dash (-)
- Number of subdomains

### 2. **Domain-Based Features**
- Domain age and registration length
- SSL certificate status and validity
- WHOIS information availability
- Domain rank and reputation
- DNS record analysis

### 3. **HTML & JavaScript Features**
- Number of external links
- Percentage of external URLs
- Form action properties
- JavaScript usage patterns
- Iframe redirection
- Status bar customization

### 4. **Abnormal Request Features**
- Server response patterns
- Redirect frequency
- Popup windows behavior
- Disable right-click functionality

## 🎯 **Business Problem**

### **Impact of Phishing Attacks:**
- Phishing websites pose significant threats due to their extremely undetectable risk, targeting user information like login ids, passwords, credit card numbers
- Financial losses exceeding billions annually
- Identity theft and privacy breaches
- Brand reputation damage for legitimate companies

### **Current Challenges:**
- Phishing campaigns last on average 12 days, requiring rapid detection
- Sophisticated attackers using advanced techniques
- Manual detection is time-consuming and error-prone
- High false positive rates in existing systems

## 🔬 **Technical Problem Statement**

### **Input Features (X)**
- 30+ engineered features extracted from URLs and website properties
- Mixed data types: binary, categorical, and numerical
- Feature values typically encoded as {-1, 0, 1} or {0, 1}

### **Target Variable (y)**
- Binary classification: 
  - **0**: Legitimate website
  - **1**: Phishing website

### **Success Metrics**
1. **Primary Metrics:**
   - **Accuracy**: Overall classification correctness
   - **Precision**: Minimize false phishing alerts
   - **Recall**: Maximize phishing detection rate
   - **F1-Score**: Balance between precision and recall

2. **Business Metrics:**
   - **False Positive Rate**: <5% (avoid blocking legitimate sites)
   - **False Negative Rate**: <2% (critical for security)
   - **Inference Time**: <100ms per URL (real-time detection)

## Data Collection ETL

## 🚀 **ML Approach Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Class imbalance analysis
- Correlation analysis and feature selection

### **Phase 2: Model Development**
- **Baseline Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees
- **Advanced Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM
- **Ensemble Methods**: Voting, Stacking, Bagging
- **Deep Learning**: Neural Networks (if dataset size permits)

### **Phase 3: Model Evaluation**
- Cross-validation (K-fold)
- ROC-AUC analysis
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Feature importance interpretation

### **Phase 4: Deployment Considerations**
- Real-time prediction pipeline
- Model monitoring and drift detection
- Continuous learning from new phishing patterns
- Integration with web browsers/security tools

## 🎯 **Expected Outcomes**

### **Technical Goals**
- Achieve >95% accuracy on test set
- Maintain <5% false positive rate
- Deploy scalable real-time detection system
- Provide interpretable feature importance

### **Business Impact**
- Reduce successful phishing attacks by 80%
- Protect user financial and personal data
- Build trust in online security systems
- Enable proactive threat detection

## 🔧 **Implementation Requirements**

### **Technical Stack**
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **ML Frameworks**: scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Deployment**: Flask/FastAPI, MongoDB
- **Monitoring**: MLflow, Prometheus

### **Performance Requirements**
- **Latency**: <100ms per prediction
- **Throughput**: >1000 requests per second
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Scalability**: Handle traffic spikes

## 📈 **Success Criteria**

1. **Model Performance**: F1-score >0.95
2. **Production Readiness**: Deployed API with monitoring
3. **User Impact**: Demonstrable reduction in phishing success rates
4. **Maintainability**: Well-documented, reproducible pipeline
